@h3 @question
The @question tag is used to mark a question to the reader
or mark anything that might still need to be answered

@shorte: exec=True
\@question
This is a question

with another paragraph. It should eventually be switched
to the same syntax as the @note and @tbd tag.

@h3 @questions
The @questions tag is used to create a Q and A type section.
For example,

@shorte: exec=True
\@questions
Q: This is a question with some more info
A: This is the answer to the question with a lot
   of detail that wraps across multiple lines and
   hopefully it will make the HTML look interesting
   but I'm not sure we'll just have to see what
   happens when it's rendered

Q: This is another question with some more information
A: This is the answer to that question
