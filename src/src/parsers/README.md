The Parsers Directory
=======================
This directory contains the implementation of parsers used
to parse shorte files or includes like C/C++ or Python
source files.

The parsers are all derived from parser\_t defined in shorte\_parser\_base.py

The cpp\_parser.py class is not currently supported. It has been replaced
by clang\_parser.py but I don't want to remove it just yet.
