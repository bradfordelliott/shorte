@h1 Testing Acronyms
The following table demonstrates the usage of acronyms within
a shorte document. Any acronyms in the first column should be automatically
cross referenced throughout the remainder of the document.

@acronyms
- Acronym | Description
- ABC     | A random acronym
- DEF     | Another random acronym

@text
This is a test of ABC and DEF. They should get automatically
cross referenced. It would be nice if they didn't get cross
referenced within the @acronyms tag itself though or at least
not within the same row of the table.

It would also be nice if I could hover on the definition and
see a hint as to what it means without having to click on it
to navigate to it.
