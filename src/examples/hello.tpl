@h1 Hello There
This is a very simple document to demonstrate the basics of
shorte. The structure of a document is similar to HTML in that it
starts with a document header followed by a document body. Tags
are created using the @tag syntax.

It supports lists
- one
    - two
- three

and tables:
@{table,
-t My Table
-h Column One ! Column Two
-  Three      ! Four
}

This is some random stuff here with a link to [[->Example: Dynamic Reconfiguration, dynamically reconfigure something]]

This is some more data
