@text: if="PUG"
This document is a collection of ideas about what features
or cleanup to implement next in shorte.

- Ignore the header if it isn't present
- Update the document header to make the parsing more sophisticated
- Need conditional text blocks - now would I support this?
- Is WebHelp open? Should I be able to generate it?
- Would like to be able to support code snippets within lists using the
    {{code block here}}
  syntax.

@text: if="CUG"
This block of text is only included if the CUG macro is defined
    
- Need to format code so I can cross reference function definitions
  similar to what Doxygen does.

- Need to enhance the if="PUG" syntax so that I can use logic to include
  or exclude certain portions. Right now my support is pretty minimal
